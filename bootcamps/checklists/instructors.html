title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Instructors
---
<p>
  Instructors lecture and lead practical exercises.
  You should also help learners during practical sessions,
  but remember to rest your voice as well.
  You <em>don't</em> need to know the curriculum
  for all the topics in your bootcamp,
  but it certainly helps
  (particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute).
</p>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you haven't already done so,
      (or haven't done so recently),
      <strong>read the relevant sections of the <a href="{{page.root}}/v5/novice/teaching/index.html">instructors' guide</a>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Arrange travel to the bootcamp site,
      accommodation,
      and transportation from your lodging
      to the bootcamp site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out (from the host) how to be reimbursed for travel expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work with the 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a> to figure out 
      who's teaching what and when.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choose or prepare your lessons,
      data sets,
      cheat sheets, 
      exercises,
      and version control repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post your exercises, data sets, and cheat sheets
      on the bootcamp's web site.
      (The lead instructor
      will create a GitHub repository
      to host the bootcamp's web pages.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Work through your own setup instructions to make sure they're complete,
      and to ensure that you have the same setup as your learners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do a dry-run of your entire lesson; 
      this allows you to try out your examples and exercises 
      to make sure they (still) work, 
      and to make sure you'll have enough time to 
      present all your material 
      (or enough material to fill your time).
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
      in case one of them pulls out or loses their voice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#instructors_practices">good instruction practices</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with
      <a href="{{page.root}}/v5/novice/teaching/index.html">teaching guide</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="well">
  <h4>During the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      One instructor should stay on top of the catering:
      replenish snacks,
      call for more coffee,
      etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>After the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complete the instructors' post-bootcamp questionnaire.
    </li>
    <li>
      Send any other feedback you have
      to Software Carpentry admin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upload improvements to common lesson material to GitHub
      and send a pull request to the master repository.
    </li>
  </ul>
