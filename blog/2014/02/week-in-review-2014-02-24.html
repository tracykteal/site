  <li>In the aftermath of last week’s tutorials on how to setup a workshop repository, <a href="http://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/337">Greg is asking for feedback</a>. In case you missed it live or for a quick refresh before a workshop, note that you can always <a href="http://vimeo.com/87241285">watch the recorded version</a>.</li>
  <li>The paper <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v1">“Software Carpentry: Lessons learned” has been published on F1000 Research</a>. The paper summarizes the 15-year-long trip of Software Carpentry and the lessons learned on the road. Read about it <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/02/f1000-lessons-learned.html">on the blog</a>.</li>
  <li>Greg Wilson <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/02/the-bigger-picture.html">wrote on the blog</a> on how Software Carpentry’s main <em>activity</em>, teaching workshops to scientists, is framed on Software Carpentry’s main <em>goal</em>, make science more open.</li>
  <li>What else is needed for code reuse? Add your thoughts <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/code-research-object/issues/2">to this issue</a> on the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/what-else-is-needed-for-code-reuse/">Science Lab's work towards a best practice</a> for their collaboration around <a href="http://mozillascience.org/code-as-a-research-object-a-new-project/">code as a research object</a>.</li>
