<h2 id="aworkshopneedsyou">A workshop needs you</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>US and Canada</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If you’re close to <strong>North Carolina</strong>, they need an instructor for a workshop at Duke University in June. A workshop in <strong>San Diego</strong> in May needs instructors and helpers, and a lot of instructors are needed in the West Coast: four at <strong>the University of California at Davis</strong>, four in total for two workshops in <strong>Stanford</strong>, and another four in <strong>Portland</strong>. In the East Coast, a workshop at <strong>the University of Delaware</strong> needs instructors. Helpers are needed for <strong>Vancouver</strong> in Canada and <strong>Atlanta</strong> in Georgia.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The double workshop, first in <strong>Cyprus</strong> and one week later in <strong>Jordan</strong>, needs one european instructor who gets hotel stays covered for the week in-between. In addition, at least one instructor is needed for a workshop in <strong>Kiel</strong>, Germany, and several for workshops in <strong>Cranfield, Nottingham, and Oxford</strong> in the UK.</li>
