http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/pdf_v2.htm has links to Excel
spreadsheets with data on higher education in science & engineering in
the US from the 1970s to the turn of the century; on that page,
http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/append/c2/at02-16.xls has
"Earned bachelor's degrees, by field and sex: 1975-98 (selected
years)".

http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/appendix.htm; on that page,
http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/append/c2/at02-18.xls has earned
bachelor's degrees by sex and field: 2000-2009.

The goal is to produce a plot showing how the numbers and gender
balance have changed in the physical sciences, the
earth/planetary/climate sciences, biological & agricultural sciences,
mathematics, computer science, psychology, and the other social
sciences over that period.  This will be tricky because (a) the
spreadsheets are formatted differently, (b) one of them presents a
combined total for biological & agricultural while the other doesn't,
and (c) there's a lot of other stuff in this spreadsheet that needs to
be ignored.

So, how quickly can people get from URLs to final plots?  And on top
of that, what can they uncover in the data about correlations or
inverse correlations between different fields?  The first is a fixed
target, the second is "make the most impressive dessert you can".
