    we have put our materials into these repositories on <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry">GitHub</a>.

  <h2>New Lesson Material</h2>

  <p>
    We welcome new lessons and exercises
    (particularly lessons that show how the things we teach fit together).
    A good exercise has a single clear focus,
    and should be doable in five minutes or less;
    for examples,
    take a look at the "Challenges" sections of
    <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/bc/lessons/swc-shell/tutorial.html">our introduction to the Unix shell</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example of what we'd like in a longer lesson,
    please look at
    <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pulls">the pull requests in our lesson repository</a>.
    And if you have ideas of your own,
    please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email us</a>:
    we'd be happy to chat.

    If you want to help us by programming,
    there are lots of things we need.
    Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>
    if you'd like to tackle any of these,
    or have projects of your own you'd like to suggest.

  <dl>

    <dt>Diffing and Merging</dt>
    <dd>
      A groups of students have built
      <a href="http://nbdiff.org/">a diff-and-merge tool for the IPython Notebook</a>.
      Polishing this would help everyone in the IPython community,
      not just us.
    </dd>

    <dt>Blocks and Images</dt>
    <dd>
      <a href="http://github.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks">ipythonblocks</a>
      and
      <a href="http://github.com/synesthesiam/novice">skimage.novice</a>
      have let us adopt a media-first approach to teaching programming.
      Enhancements to either of these are very welcome.
    </dd>

    <dt>Browsercast</dt>
    <dd>
      Gabriel Ivanica is building an HTML5-based tool for playing slideshows in sync with a voiceover.
      This project builds on <a href="https://github.com/tarmstrong/bcast-experiments/">earlier work</a>;
      see <a href="http://blog.gabrielivanica.com/2014/04/25/browsercast-google-summer-2014/">this blog post</a>
      for more information.
    </dd>

    <dt>Peer Instruction on the Web</dt>
    <dd>
      Piotr Banaszkiewicz is developing a web-based tool for peer instruction,
      a teaching technique which has been proven to be more effective than traditional lecturing.
      For more information,
      see
      <a href="http://piotr.banaszkiewicz.org/blog/2014/04/24/peer-instruction-a-summer-project-for-mozilla/">this blog post</a>
      or <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/peer-instruction">his GitHub repository</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Turtle Graphics</dt>
    <dd>
      Turtle graphics goes all the way back to the original work at MIT on teaching kids to program
      and Paper's wonderful book
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746"><em>Mindstorms</em></a>.
      Several students at <a href="http://www.macewan.ca">MacEwan University</a>
      have built <a href="https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/PACattack">a prototype</a>;
      further work would be very welcome.
    </dd>

    <dt>A Perl Back End</dt>
    <dd>
      The IPython Notebook doesn't have to use Python as the back-end process:
      they've defined a JSON-based protocol for communicating with arbitrary processes,
      and people have already built a replacement back-end in Julia (and are working on one in R).
      There are lots of Perl programmers in science;
      a Perl back-end would probably get a lot of love.
